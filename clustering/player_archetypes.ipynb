    "# Player Archetypes in Modern Football\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all centre-backs are the same. Not all strikers play like each other. Modern football has evolved far beyond simple position labels — a \"midfielder\" could be a deep-lying playmaker, a box-to-box runner, or a creative number 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis identifies **distinct player archetypes** within each position by examining 20 quality dimensions that capture how a player actually plays. We analyse **93,000+ player-seasons** across **129 top-flight leagues** (2018–2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two approaches:\n",
    "- **K-Means**: Hard assignment — each player belongs to exactly one archetype\n",
    "- **Gaussian Mixture (GMM)**: Soft assignment — each player has a *probability* of belonging to each archetype (e.g., \"91% Clinical Finisher, 6% Target Man, 3% False Nine\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The GMM approach is richer because real players don’t fit neatly into one box. A player like Harry Kane might be 70% Clinical Finisher and 30% Playmaking Striker — and that mix changes over seasons."

    "## The 20 Qualities That Define a Footballer\n",
    "\n",
    "Every player-season in our dataset is described by 20 **quality scores** developed by Twelve Football. These are not raw counting stats — they are contextualised ratings that capture *how well* a player does something, not just how often. A quality score of +1.0 means the player is roughly one level above average for their position; −1.0 is one level below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We group them into five families:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defending\n",
    "| Quality | What it captures |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Active defence** | Willingness and success at winning the ball back — tackles, interceptions, recoveries |\n",
    "| **Pressing** | Intensity and effectiveness of pressing the opponent when out of possession |\n",
    "| **Intelligent defence** | Positional awareness, reading passing lanes, anticipation |\n",
    "| **Winning duels** | Success in 1v1 ground and aerial duels in defensive situations |\n",
    "| **Chance prevention** | Ability to block shots, reduce xG through defensive positioning |\n",
    "| **Territorial dominance** | Control of defensive territory — how much area a defender commands |\n",
    "| **Defensive heading** | Aerial prowess in defensive situations — clearing crosses and set pieces |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ball Progression\n",
    "| Quality | What it captures |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Dribbling** | Carrying ability — beating opponents on the ball, retaining under pressure |\n",
    "| **Progression** | Moving the ball forward effectively through passes and carries |\n",
    "| **Run quality** | Movement off the ball — making intelligent runs into dangerous areas |\n",
    "| **Composure** | Retaining possession under pressure, avoiding turnovers |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating\n",
    "| Quality | What it captures |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Passing quality** | Technical range and accuracy of passing — short, long, through balls |\n",
    "| **Providing teammates** | Creating chances for teammates — key passes, assists, pre-assists |\n",
    "| **Involvement** | Overall contribution to team build-up — touches, receptions, link-up play |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring\n",
    "| Quality | What it captures |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Box threat** | Presence in the penalty area — getting into dangerous positions |\n",
    "| **Finishing** | Converting chances — goals relative to xG, shot technique |\n",
    "| **Poaching** | Pure goalscoring instinct — anticipation, positioning for tap-ins |\n",
    "| **Effectiveness** | Clinical efficiency — doing a lot with limited touches |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical / Aerial\n",
    "| Quality | What it captures |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Aerial threat** | Offensive aerial presence — winning headers in advanced areas |\n",
    "| **Hold-up play** | Ability to receive with back to goal and retain possession for the team |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Position-specific filtering**: Not every quality is relevant for every position. For example, \"Chance prevention\" has less than 80% data coverage for midfielders, wingers, and strikers — so we exclude it for those positions. This avoids distorting the archetype detection with noisy or missing data."

    "## Full Backs: The Most Evolved Position in Modern Football\n",
    "\n",
    "No position in football has changed as dramatically as the full back. In the 1990s, a full back’s job was simple: defend the flank, overlap occasionally, put in a cross. Today, the role is unrecognisable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverted full backs** tuck inside like midfielders (Joao Cancelo under Guardiola)\n",
    "- **Attacking wingbacks** function almost as wingers (Trent Alexander-Arnold, Achraf Hakimi)\n",
    "- **Defensive full backs** still exist — solid, positional, no-frills (Cesar Azpilicueta)\n",
    "- **Creative full backs** provide the primary chance creation from wide areas\n",
    "\n",
    "This diversity makes full backs one of the most interesting positions for archetype analysis."

A player is not just \"a Clinical Finisher\" — they might be 70% Clinical Finisher in one season, then shift towards 50% Clinical Finisher / 30% Playmaking Striker the next.\n",

    "- **Harry Kane** transitioned from a pure finisher to a playmaking striker over time\n",
    "- **Trent Alexander-Arnold** evolved from an overlapping full back to a creative/inverted role\n",

    "|---|-----------|-----------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Division 1 only** | We restrict to top-flight leagues to ensure quality scores are comparable. Second-division players face different opposition quality. |\n",
    "| 2 | **No goalkeepers** | Goalkeepers have a fundamentally different quality profile. They are excluded entirely. |\n",
    "| 3 | **20 Twelve Football quality scores** | These are the core player evaluation dimensions provided by Twelve Football’s framework. |\n",
    "| 4 | **Position-specific quality exclusions** | Qualities with <80% data coverage for a position are excluded to avoid distortion from missing data (e.g., Poaching excluded for CBs). |\n",
    "| 5 | **Both K-Means and GMM presented** | K-Means gives clean labels; GMM gives richer probabilities. Both are included for the supervisor to decide which to use downstream. |\n",
    "| 6 | **Number of archetypes auto-selected** | For each position, we test k=3 to 7 and pick the largest k where the smallest archetype still contains at least 8% of players. This avoids micro-clusters. |\n",
    "| 7 | **De-duplication** | First occurrence per (player, team, season) is kept. A player who transferred mid-season appears once per club-season. |\n",
    "| 8 | **Minimum 500 minutes** | Already enforced in the source data — only player-seasons with at least 500 minutes are included. |\n",
    "| 9 | **Re-standardisation before clustering** | Quality scores are standardised (mean=0, std=1) within each position group before clustering, so that all qualities contribute equally. |"
